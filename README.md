# SCHOOL SYSTEM

## Overview

This Java project simulates a simple school system with classes for managing students and courses. The project includes features such as enrolling and unenrolling students, counting students, finding the best grade in a course, and additional challenges like calculating the average grade and displaying a student ranking.

## Classes

### Student Class

The `Student` class represents a student with attributes such as first name, last name, registration number, grade, and current year. It implements methods like `printFullName`, `isApproved`, and `changeYearIfApproved`.

### Course Class

The `Course` class represents a course with attributes including course name, professor name, and year. It contains a collection of students enrolled in the course and methods like `enroll`, `unEnroll`, `countStudents`, and `bestGrade`.

## Additional Features

- **Method Overload:**
  The `enroll` method is overloaded to accept an array of students, allowing for bulk enrollment.

- **Challenges:**
  - Calculate the average grade for the course.
  - Output a ranking with all students enrolled in the course and their respective grades.
  - Show if each student is above or below the course average.
